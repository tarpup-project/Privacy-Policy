## 4. Content Moderation, Reporting, and Blocking

Tarpup Connect includes user-generated content and community interaction features. To maintain a safe environment:

- Users may **report or flag content or accounts** they believe are objectionable, abusive, or in violation of platform rules

- Reports and block actions may be reviewed by automated systems and human moderators

We aim to review and take appropriate action on valid reports, including content removal or account enforcement, in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable laws.
